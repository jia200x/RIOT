# 1. Abstract

This memo describes the proposed Hardware Abstraction Layer for radios
compliant with the IEEE802.15.4 standard. The work follows a technology specific
approach to provide a well known layer for implementing agnostic IEEE802.15.4
PHY and MAC or integrating network stacks that require direct access
to the radio (OpenWSN)

The work presented in this document addresses the problems of using `netdev`
as a Hardware Abstraction Layer:
- It's too generic to be used as a HAL, considering the semantics
  of radio devices are technology specific and usually well defined.
- It includes PHY and MAC components that are not in the scope of a Radio HAL.
  This pulls much more code than needed and makes harder to implement and
  maintain a device driver.
- The interface doesn't expose primitive operations (set transceiver state) and
  hardcode MAC layer specific functionalities (internal state changes, etc).

# 2. Status

This document is currently under open discussions. This document is a product of
the [Lower Network Stack rework](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/12688)
and aims to describe the architecture of the IEEE802.15.4 radio abstraction
layer.

# 3. Introduction
This document defines the proposed API for the IEEE802.15.4 radio abstraction
layer.

The IEEE802.15.4 Radio HAL abstract common functionalities of IEEE802.15.4
compliant radios, so upper layers have a hardware independent layer to control
the radio.

In our current architecture, components of the 802.15.4 MAC are spread between
the IEEE802.15.4 component of the network interface (`gnrc_netif_ieee802154`)
and `netdev`. This strategy has some issues:
- The `netdev` has Link Layer semantics, so it's problematic to integrate
  network stacks that require radio access (OpenWSN) or write a 802.15.4 MAC
  layer
- The `gnrc_netif_ieee80214` components of the 802.15.4 MAC are GNRC specific
  and cannot be reused in other network stacks.

Ideally, these components should be separated in:
1. Network Stack specific glue code (netif) that operates the Link Layer
2. Link Layer (802.15.4 MAC)
3. Radio Hardware Abstraction Layer

The last one (Radio HAL) is intended to control IEEE802.15.4 radios in a
hardware independent manner. For instance, a 802.15.4 MAC layer (not in the
scope of this document) would use the Radio HAL to implement the SubMAC
components like sending and receiving data, retransmissions with CSMA-CA, etc.
It can also be used to have raw access to radios (e.g test aplications,
very simple communication protocols) and to integrate network stacks that
require direct access to the radio device (OpenWSN, OpenThread).

The following picture compares the current RIOT lower network architecture with
the approach described above:

Compared to the `netdev` interface, the 802.15.4 Radio HAL is more specific and
only includes pure radio operations. Note that the blocks in the old approach
are not necessarily at the same layer as the ones in the new approach, because
the current lower layer architecture doesn't have a clear layer distinction.

```

As shown in the above figure, the IEEE802.15.4 Radio HAL is a central component that provides any upper layer
a technology dependent and unified access to the hardware specific device driver, by implementing the Radio HAL API.
Since devices drivers do not depend on the Radio HAL, it is still
possible to use a the raw driver of a specific device, for testing purposes or accessing device specific
features.

Similar to the preceding approach based on `netdev` , the Radio HAL requires an upper layer to take over the Bottom-Half
processing which means, offloading the ISR to thread context.
This allows for different event processing mechanisms such as `msg`, `thread flags`, `event threads`, etc. 
The Bottom-Half processor should use the Radio HAL API to process the IRQ.

## 4.1 Upper layer
Upper layers are users that requires direct access to the primitive
operations of a radio and its hardware acceleration features, if available.

Examples for Upper Layers:
- A MAC layer can use the Radio HAL to implement parts of a PHY layer (data
communication, set/get parameters, perform CCA, etc.) .
- A network stack that requires direct access to the radio (OpenWSN,
  OpenThread) can use the Radio HAL to implement the integration code.
- A developer who implements a simple application to send and receive
  data between 802.15.4 radios (relying on hardware accelerated MAC features, if available).

The upper layer accesses the radio using the Radio HAL API. Events that are triggered
by the device (packet received, transmission finished) are indicated by an event notification
mechanism, described below.

## 4.2 Bottom-Half processor
The Bottom-Half (BH) processor is a component to offload the IRQ processing to thread context.
The component registers an IRQ handler during initialization which is executed when the device triggers and interrupt.
This handler uses internal mechanisms to call the Radio API IRQ handler from a safe context.

The BH processor can be implemented dependent or independent of the network stack. A network
stack independent solution is preferred in order to reuse functionality between different
network stacks.

## 4.3 Radio HAL

The Radio HAL is defined by the Radio HAL API which consists of three main components:
Radio Operations, Event Notification, and the Device Specific IEEE802.15.4 HAL implementation.

The Radio HAL Implementation provides a set of functionalities to control
the operation of the device, to process the IRQ handler and to receive event
notifications from the device.

### 4.3.1 Radio Operations
The Radio Operations (`radio_ops`) interface exposes operations that are common to control 802.15.4 devices,
to request their hardware capabilities information (i.e., MAC acceleration hardware) and to process
the radio IRQ.

The interface defines a collection of mandatory functions:
- Set the transceiver state
- Set the PHY configuration (channel, tx power, etc)
- Load and transmit a frame
- Get device capabilities
- Process IRQ

The interface provides a collection of optional functions that may or may not be implemented, dependent on
the hardware acceleration features of a device. These functions include:
- Read the number of retransmissions
- Set address filter addresses (extended, short, PAN ID)
- Set CSMA-CA backoff parameters.

The full list of functions can be found in the Interface Definition section.

### 4.3.2 Event Notification
The Radio HAL provides an Event Notification mechanism to inform the upper layer
about an event (a packet was received, a transmission finished, etc).

The upper layer can subscribe to these events to perform different actions. A an example,
a MAC layer would subscribe to the RX done event to allocate the
received packet. The TX done event is commonly used to release resources or
update statistics.

The full list of events and implications are defined in the Interface Definition
section.

### 4.3.3 Device Specific IEEE802.15.4 HAL implementation
The Device Specific IEEE802.15.4 HAL implementation is part of the IEEE802.15.4 Radio HAL component
in the above figure. It implements the hardware dependent part of the IEEE802.15.4 Radio
HAL by wrapping the `radio_ops` interface around the device specific code by using the Device Driver API
which grants access to all device operations.

## 4.4 Device Driver
The Device Driver implements the Hardware Adoption Layer of the device. It
should provide minimal functionalities to implement the Device Specific
API, and it additionally provides a mechanism to expose the ISR of the radio, so the Bottom-Half
processor can offload the ISR.

The function set of the Device Driver can include device specific features that are not
exposed but the Radio HAL API (e.g., Smart Listening with AT86RF2xx radios).
The Device Driver is an independent component and it can be used without the Radio HAL on top, for testing purposes
or device specific applications.


# 5 Interface definition and implementation details
## 5.1.1 Init vs Start
In order to implement the 802.15.4 on top of a device driver, the driver
requires to separate the the initialization process of the device in 2
stages:
- Init: This stage sets up the device driver (analogue to the current
  `xxx_setup` functions) and puts it in a state that minimizes power
  consumption.
- Start: This state is intended to be triggered during network interface
  initialization (e.g `ifconfig up`) to put the device in a state where is
  ready to operate (enable IRQ lines, turn on the transceiver, etc).

Explicitly separating the Init and Start process is more efficient in terms
of power consumption, because a network stack might take some time to set an
interface up.

The Radio HAL "start" function should be mapped to the Start stage proposed
above.

## 5.1.2 Explicit transceiver states
Following the IEEE802.15.4 PHY definition, there are only 3 transceiver states:

```c
typedef enum {
    IEEE802154_TRX_STATE_TRX_OFF, /**< the transceiver state if off */
    IEEE802154_TRX_STATE_RX_ON, /**< the transceiver is ready to receive packets */
    IEEE802154_TRX_STATE_TX_ON, /**< the transceiver is ready to send packets */
} ieee802154_trx_state_t;
```

The implementation of the HAL is responsible to map other states to the
PHY state. For instance, a radio in sleep mode or with the transceiver disabled
will map to the same `TRX_OFF` state.  This simplify a lot the operation and
implementation of the HAL.

Some functions of the radio API require that the transceiver is on a specific
state. This does not only allow the usage of upper layers that require total
control of the radio (OpenWSN) but also ensures that the radio is always in a
well known state since the HAL won't perform any hidden state change. It also
avoid unnecessary state changes.

For instance, functions to prepare and transmit packets require the radio to be
in `TX_ON` state.

The only exception is the "sleep" function (that sets the state to `TRX_OFF`).
There might be some flags in the future to allow the radio to change to a well
defined state after certain operations. E.g if the radio doesn't allow CSMA-CA
but provides Auto CCA, the radio should try to send data as soon as possible.
Some radios alreayd include this feature to automatically change to `TX_ON`
after CCA without an explicit call to the function to set the transceiver state.

## 5.3 Prepare and transmit
The Radio HAL defines separates the send procedure in preloading the frame
buffer and triggering the transmissions start. This is required for MAC layers
with timing contraints. (E.g TSCH mode of 802.15.4 MAC)

It's expected that a proper "send" function is defined by a higher layer (for
instance a 802.15.4 MAC or a helper function)

## 5.4 TX and RX info
All information associated to the reception of a packet (LQI, RSSI) as well
as the transmission information (if a device supports frame retransmissions) is
exposed to the user via the Radio HAL API.

However, requesting this information is optional. An application might not be
interested in the RSSI information or the TX status if unconfirmed MAC messages
are sent.

## 5.5 Thread Safety

The radio API is designed to be called from a single thread context. Thus,
the API is not thread safe. However, as long as the the API functions are
called sequencially, it would be possible to use any synchronization mechanism
to use the radio in a multi-thread environment.
The API guarantees that the event callback is invoked from the
process IRQ function of the Radio HAL, so this should be taken into
consideration when implementing a synchronization mechanism for a multi-thread
environment (e.g usage of recursive mutex).

## 5.6 802.15.4 Radio HAL definition

### 5.6.1 Radio Ops interface definition
The Radio Ops interface is implemented using vtables (function pointers)
Although this pattern can be implemented with switch-case, there some evidence
suggesting that for this case the vtable approach can generate more efficient
instructions and it's easier to write. 

See the Appendix to see the comparison betweem the switch-case and vtable
approach.

These functions should be implemented with device specific validations only.
Everything that's not device specific (valid channels, address length, etc)
should be checked by higher layers. This avoids redundant checks.

Note the Radio Ops interface has just a few getters. This is done on purpose,
because it's assumed that higher layers will already have a copy of the PIB and
MIB.

### 5.6.2 Event Notification definition

The Event Notification mechanism is defined with a function callback that is
supposed to be implemented by the upper layer.

The callback signature, the events and their expected behavior are available
in the following snippet:

```c
typedef enum {
    /**
     * @brief the transceiver detected a valid SFD
     */
    IEEE802154_RADIO_RX_START,

    /**
     * @brief the transceiver received a packet and there's a packet in the
     *        internal framebuffer.
     *
     * The transceiver is in @ref IEEE802154_TRX_STATE_RX_ON state when
     * this funcion is called, but with framebuffer protection (either
     * dynamic framebuffer protection or disabled RX). Thus, the packet
     * won't be overwritten before calling the @ref ieee802154_radio_read
     * function. However, @ref ieee802154_radio_read MUST be called in
     * order to receive new packets. If there's no interest in the
     * packet, the function can be called with a NULL buffer to drop
     * the packet.
     */
    IEEE802154_RADIO_RX_DONE,

    /**
     * @brief the transceiver finished sending a packet or the
     *        retransmission procedure
     *
     * If the radio supports frame retransmissions the 
     * @ref ieee802154_radio_get_tx_status MAY be called to retrieve useful
     * information (number of retries, frame pending bit, etc). The
     * transceiver is in @ref IEEE802154_TRX_STATE_TX_ON state when this function
     * is called.
     */
    IEEE802154_RADIO_TX_DONE,
    /**
     * @brief the transceiver reports that the ACK timeout expired
     *
     * This event is present only if the radio support ACK timeout.
     */
    IEEE802154_RADIO_ACK_TIMEOUT,
    /**
     * @brief the transceiver received a packet but the CRC check failed
     */
    IEEE802154_RADIO_CRC_FAIL,
} ieee802154_trx_ev_t;

/**
 * @brief Prototype of the IEEE802.15.4 device event callback
 *
 * @param[in] dev IEEE802.15.4 device descriptor
 * @param[in] status the status 
 */
typedef void (*ieee802154_cb_t)(ieee802154_dev_t *dev,
                                ieee802154_tx_status_t status);
```

Other MAC specific events are not included (e.g TX done with frame pending,
CSMA-CA medium busy or exceeded number of retranmissions). This can be
extracted on TX done event using the Radio HAL API.

It's safe to call the radio HAL API from the event callback function.

### 5.6.3 Radio capabilities
The following list defines the basic capabilities available in common
IEEE802.15.4 compliants radios. More caps can be added to support other
hardware features.

```c
typedef enum {
    /**
     * @brief the device supports hardware address filter
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_HW_ADDR_FILTER,
    /**
     * @brief the device support frame retransmissions with CSMA-CA
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_FRAME_RETRIES,
    /**
     * @brief the device support ACK timeout interrupt
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_ACK_TIMEOUT,
    /**
     * @brief the device supports Auto ACK
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_AUTO_ACK,
    /**
     * @brief the device performs CCA when sending
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_24_GHZ,
    /**
     * @brief the device support the IEEE802.15.4 Sub GHz band
     */
    IEEE802154_CAP_SUB_GHZ,
} ieee802154_rf_caps_t;
```

### 5.6.4 802.15.4 Radio Hal Device Descriptor
The 802.15.4 Device Descriptor simply holds the Radio Ops driver and the Event
Notification for an instance of a device.
It has the following structure:
```c
/**
 * @brief the IEEE802.15.4 device descriptor
 */
struct ieee802154_dev {
    /**
     * @brief pointer to the operations of the device
     */
    const ieee802154_radio_ops_t *driver;
    /**
     * @brief the event callback of the device
     */
    ieee802154_cb_t cb;
};
```

The allocation of the HAL descriptor and pointer to the actual device
instance is up to the implementor of the HAL. For instance, the first member
of the internal device descriptor can be an `ieee802154_dev_t` struct, but other
techniques are also possible.
